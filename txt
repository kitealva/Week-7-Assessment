1. extraLargeArray: Insert 638.3409 ms & Append 2.445 ms.

2. tinyArray: Insert 639.0905 ms & 82.1 nanoseconds.

3. smallArray: Insert 633.9559 ms & 82.2 nanoseconds.

4. mediumArray: Insert 625.6962 ms & 113.6 nanoseconds.

5. largeArray: Insert 636.6251 ms & 454.3 nanoseconds.

5. The append function runs the times faster if it is larger and then the insert will run faster for the smaller sized amounts.

6. The reason why it would be more so slower is because it has to take from a already existing thing and take that copy. The other would be faster just because you can insert something new rather than search and find a copy you use. The un shift of the object makes it slower as well
